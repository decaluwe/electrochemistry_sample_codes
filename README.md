# MEGN 570 Code Examples

This repository will be used to post sample codes developed in class or as part of the HW solutions.

Feel free to copy and paste specific lines of code or routines, or copy and adapt entire files, however you deem it useful, for your own homework assignments and your class project.  While a goal of the course is to give you some skills with modern software techniques, development, and application, it is not a coding course, per se.  Besdies which, copying and re-using existing code is a significant part of "good" coding, anyway! :)
